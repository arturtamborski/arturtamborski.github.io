Hi, I'm Artur and this is my blog :)

You can find here some of my posts about programming, tinkering with 
electronics and more.

I'm interested in pretty much every aspect of the Information Technology.  
I also play the bass guitar and love pretty much every genre of music.


Here's [my CV](/cv).

If you would like to know more about me then you can check out my [geekcode](/geekcode.txt).

You can find me on [linkedin](/linkedin) and [github](/github) where I keep the source code of my projects.

There's also my [twitter](/twitter) where I post some random thoughts.

You can contact me via [telegram](/telegram) or [email](/email).
