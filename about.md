Hi, I'm Artur and this is my blog.
You can find here posts about programming, computers and stuff.

I'm interested in almost every aspect of Information Technology.  
I also like to know how things work in a detailed manner.  
Besides that I love pretty much every genre of music.

If you would like to see more about me then you could check out my [github](https://github.com/arturtamborski/) profile where I keep the source code of my projects, or my [twitter](https://twitter.com/arturtamborski) account where I post some random thoughts.

You can contact me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/arturtamborski) or via [email](mailto:tamborskiartur@gmail.com).
