Hi, I'm Artur and this is my blog :)

You can find here some of my posts about programming, tinkering with 
electronics and more.

I'm interested in pretty much every aspect of the Information Technology.  
I also play the bass guitar and love pretty much every genre of music.


Here's [my CV]({{ site.assets_dir }}/cv-artur-tamborski.pdf).

If you would like to know more about me then you can check out my [geekcode](/geekcode.txt).

You can find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arturtamborski) and [github](https://github.com/arturtamborski/) where I keep the source code of my projects.

There's also my [twitter](https://twitter.com/arturtamborski) where I post some random thoughts (and [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@arturtamborski) but I don't use it that often).

You can contact me via [telegram](https://telegram.me/arturtamborski), [keybase](https://keybase.io/arturtamborski) or [email](mailto:tamborskiartur@gmail.com).
