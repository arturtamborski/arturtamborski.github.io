Hi, I'm Artur and this is my blog :)

You can find here posts about programming, tinkering with electronics and more.

I'm interested in almost every aspect of technology and I like to know how things work.
Besides that I love pretty much every genre of music.

If you would like to know more about me then you can check out my [geekcode](/geekcode.txt).

You can find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arturtamborski) and [github](https://github.com/arturtamborski/) where I keep the source code of my projects.

There's also my [twitter](https://twitter.com/arturtamborski) where I post some random thoughts.

You can contact me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/arturtamborski) or via [email](mailto:tamborskiartur@gmail.com).
