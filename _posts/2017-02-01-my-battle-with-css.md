I'm bad at design, like, really really bad, but I'm also quite stubborn so 
I styled this blog so long until it looked nice to me.


So when the time came to finally publish my site I needed to quickly fix it 
up and release it to the world, easy enough, right? Well... I was wrong. Very wrong.


I wanted to try out bootstrap first, but it was too feature rich and heavy, 
so I began my two-day journey on searching the perfect lightweight framework.


I went trough many of them, and each one of them was bad for me:
  - `bootstrap` was too heavy,
  - `pure` felt too raw,
  - `min` was even more severe,
  - `cardinal` had weird docs,
  - `skeleton` practically didn't have docs.


And then I've found the `spectre` which looked so great that I was instantly hooked up!


While I was on my invention-wave I quickly created some test pages, 
but I felt into the first trap - trying everything at once without understanding how it works before. 
I quickly lost there a few hours without gaining much knowledge.


When I realized, that I can't progress this way, I changed my plan to copying original 
docs as my template, but this was another trap - project's page had its own separate 
stylesheet next to framework so page used many of functionalities not available in default framework.


After few solid hours of procrastination, I started to force my way trough CSS just so 
I could end this battle.

And finally, at 3 am I have finished most of my page and it looked quite good!


In summary, I think that front end is definitely not for me, I just don't enjoy it, 
because it's like a never-ending battle.
I even noticed one funny thing - it was easier for me to write this blog from the ground 
up in python than creating a style sheet for it, even trough it took more time, 
it still was easier and way more enjoyable.


TL;DR I suck at web design and frontend :)


Note: Thats an old article describing by first blog written in Django few years ago. You can still find its ugly code on my github, but I advise you against that for your own safety ;)
